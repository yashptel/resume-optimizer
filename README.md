## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Upload PDF] --> B[pdfplumber\nextract text]
    B --> C[Gemini Flash\nstructure profile]
    C --> D[(ResumeInfo\nstored in DB)]
    E[Job Description] --> F[Gemini Pro\ntailor resume]
    D --> F
    F --> G[CustomResumeInfo\nreview & edit]
    G --> H[LaTeX builder\n+ pdflatex]
    H --> I[PDF]
```

**Phase 1 — AI Generation:** Your structured profile + the job description go to Gemini Pro, which produces a tailored, keyword-optimized resume. You can review and edit before proceeding.

**Phase 2 — PDF Compilation:** The tailored resume is converted to LaTeX using a custom document class (`resume.cls`), then compiled to PDF via `pdflatex`.

| AI | Google `google-genai` SDK, Google ADK (chat agents) |
| PDF | pdflatex + custom `resume.cls`, pdfplumber for extraction |
| Frontend | Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS + Pinia — all via CDN, no build step |
| Auth | Google OAuth 2.0 → JWT |
| Payments | Razorpay (credit packs, time passes) |
| Storage | Google Cloud Storage |
| Package mgr | [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+**
- **Docker** (for PostgreSQL)
- **TeX Live** with `pdflatex`
  - macOS: `brew install --cask mactex`
  - Ubuntu: `apt install texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended lmodern`
- **UV** package manager: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

### Setup

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/cydratech/ats-beater.git && cd ats-beater

# Copy environment file and fill in your keys
cp .env.example .env

# Start PostgreSQL
docker compose up -d

# Install dependencies
uv sync --extra dev

# Run database migrations
uv run alembic upgrade head

# Start the server
uv run python -m app.main
```

Open **http://localhost:8000**. Set `DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=true` in `.env` to skip Google OAuth during development.

### Required API Keys

| Key | Where to get it |
|-----|----------------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) — create OAuth 2.0 credentials |
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` / `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` | [Razorpay Dashboard](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/) (optional — for payments) |

## Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (in-memory SQLite, no external dependencies)
uv run pytest tests/ -v --ignore=tests/integration

# Integration smoke tests (needs running DB + Gemini API key + pdflatex)
INTEGRATION=1 uv run pytest tests/integration/ -v
```

173 unit tests covering models, schemas, API routes, LaTeX builder/sanitizer, JWT handler, credit service, and more.

### Admin
Full CRUD for tenants, users, domain rules, credit packs, time passes, promo codes, and transactions under `/admin/*`. Requires `is_super_admin` flag.

## Admin & Roles

### Setting up a super admin

The first user to sign up won't have admin access. Set it directly in the database:

```sql
UPDATE users SET is_super_admin = true WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

Once set, the **Admin** tab appears in the sidebar. Super admins can:
- View dashboard KPIs (users, jobs, revenue, LLM usage)
- Manage users (search, assign tenants, grant credits)
- Create/edit credit packs and time passes
- Create/manage promo codes
- View all transactions
- Manage tenants and domain rules

### Multi-Tenancy & Domain Rules

Tenants are organizations (companies, universities) used for labeling — **not data isolation**. All data remains scoped by user.

**How it works:**
1. Create a tenant in the Admin panel (e.g. "MIT", "Google")
2. Add a domain rule mapping an email domain to that tenant (e.g. `mit.edu` → "MIT")
3. When a user signs up via Google OAuth with `@mit.edu`, they're auto-assigned to the "MIT" tenant

**Manual assignment:** Admins can also manually assign any user to a tenant from the Users tab.

**What tenants give you:**
- Organizational labeling in the admin panel
- Tenant name shown on user profiles
- Ability to filter/search users by organization
- Domain-based auto-assignment on signup

```sql
-- Example: Create a tenant and domain rule
INSERT INTO tenants (id, name) VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'MIT');
INSERT INTO tenant_domain_rules (tenant_id, domain)
  VALUES ('<tenant-id-from-above>', 'mit.edu');
```

Or do it via the Admin UI → Settings tab → Tenants & Domain Rules.

## Credit System

| Priority | Source | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Active time pass | Unlimited (no deduction) |
| 2 | Daily free | 3/day (configurable), resets at midnight UTC |
| 3 | Purchased credits | From balance |
| 4 | No credits | 429 error, frontend shows paywall |

Credits are deducted synchronously before generation starts. If generation fails, a refund is issued automatically.

### Promo Codes

Admins can create promo codes from the Admin panel:
- **CREDITS type** — adds N credits to the user's balance
- **TIME_PASS type** — activates a time pass tier (unlimited generations for N days)
- One redemption per user per code
- Optional max total redemptions and expiry date
- Time passes stack: if a user buys a second pass while one is active, the new pass starts at the old expiry

## AI Chat Agents

Both the profile and job pages have AI chat panels powered by [Google ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) (Agent Development Kit).

### Profile Chat (`profile_editor` agent)
- Reads and edits the user's master profile data (`ResumeInfo`)
- Tools: `get_profile`, `edit_profile` (JSON Patch operations)
- Knows the full product flow — correctly directs users to the Jobs section for PDF downloads
- Will not fabricate UI elements that don't exist

### Job Chat (`resume_editor` agent)
- Reads and edits the tailored resume (`CustomResumeInfo`)
- Tools: `get_resume`, `edit_resume` (JSON Patch operations)
- After edits, auto-recompiles the PDF in the background
- Knows about the fixed LaTeX template — will explain section ordering when asked
- Refuses to generate fake metrics or fabricate experience

### Chat persistence
Chat history is stored via ADK's `DatabaseSessionService` in PostgreSQL (`sessions` and `events` tables). Sessions are keyed by `profile_chat_{id}` or `job_chat_{id}`.

## Resume Roast

Free feature — no credits required. Users upload a PDF and get:
1. **Comedic roast** — AI-generated roast points about the resume
2. **ATS readiness checklist** — 8 criteria (machine readability, contact info, skills, dates, etc.)
3. **Shareable link** — public URL with OG meta tags for social sharing

Roasts use content-based deduplication (SHA-256 hash). Re-uploading the same PDF returns the cached result.

### Share link analytics
Every view of a shared roast link is tracked (`roast_views` table) with:
- IP address, user agent, referer
- Parsed platform (WhatsApp, etc.), OS, browser

## Deployment

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t ats-beater .
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env ats-beater
```

### Cloud Run

```bash
export GCP_PROJECT_ID=your-project
bash infra/deploy-cloudrun.sh
```

The deploy script handles Artifact Registry, Docker build, push, and Cloud Run deployment. See `infra/deploy-cloudrun.sh` for details.

### Dokploy

Use `docker-compose-deploy.yml` with **Docker Compose** mode, not **Stack** mode. Dokploy Stack uses
`docker stack deploy`, which ignores `build:` and requires prebuilt images from a registry.

Recommended Dokploy setup:

1. Set the compose type to `docker-compose`
2. Set the compose path to `./docker-compose-deploy.yml`
3. Add your runtime secrets in Dokploy's Environment tab
4. Set `DATABASE_URL` to use the internal Postgres hostname:
   `postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/custom_resume_dev`
5. Configure the public domain in Dokploy's **Domains** tab and target container port `8080`

The Dokploy compose file intentionally keeps Postgres in the same deployment, waits for the database
healthcheck before starting the app, and relies on Dokploy Domains UI for routing instead of manual
Traefik labels in the repo.

### Environment

All configuration is via environment variables. See `.env.example` for the full list.

For production, you'll need:
- PostgreSQL instance (Cloud SQL or self-hosted)
- GCS bucket for PDF storage
- Google OAuth credentials with correct redirect URI
- Razorpay keys (optional — for payments)

## Pre-flight Check

Verify all external services before deploying:

```bash
uv run python infra/preflight.py
```

Checks PostgreSQL connectivity + schema, Gemini Flash & Pro models, LaTeX compiler, and GCS bucket. Exits with code 0 if all pass, 1 if any fail.

## Troubleshooting

### "LaTeX compilation timed out"
- pdflatex has a 90-second timeout per pass. Image-heavy PDFs or CPU-constrained containers can hit this.
- Fix: increase CPU allocation (2 vCPU recommended) or increase `PDFLATEX_TIMEOUT` in `app/services/latex/compiler.py`.

### "No /Root object! - Is this really a PDF?"
- The uploaded file isn't a valid PDF (might be a .docx or image renamed to .pdf).
- The frontend enforces a 5MB limit and PDF MIME type check.

### "Memory limit exceeded"
- Large/image-heavy PDFs can cause pdfplumber to consume excessive memory during text extraction.
- Fix: increase container memory (2Gi recommended) or reduce the upload size limit.

### LaTeX special characters breaking compilation
- The sanitizer (`app/services/latex/sanitizer.py`) escapes `& % $ # _ { } ~ ^` and common Unicode.
- URLs are handled specially — only `%` is escaped (to `\%`) to prevent LaTeX comment breakage.
- If you encounter a new character that breaks compilation, add it to `_UNICODE_MAP` or `handle_special_chars`.

### Chat returns "A chat request is already in progress"
- Concurrency is managed via in-memory task tracking (`_active_tasks` dict).
- This can happen if a previous request crashed without cleanup. Refreshing the page clears it.

### OAuth redirect mismatch
- Ensure `FRONTEND_URL` matches your domain exactly (including `https://`).
- Add `{FRONTEND_URL}/auth/google/callback` to your Google OAuth authorized redirect URIs.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Two-phase generation** — AI tailoring and PDF compilation are separate. Users can review/edit the AI output before committing to PDF.
- **Background processing** — Profile OCR and job generation run as tracked async tasks with independent DB sessions.
- **Dual extraction** — pdfplumber first (instant), Gemini vision OCR fallback for scanned PDFs.
- **LaTeX over HTML-to-PDF** — Professional typesetting that passes ATS parsing. Custom `resume.cls` handles formatting.
- **No build step frontend** — Vue 3 CDN global build. Just static files served by FastAPI. No Node.js needed.
- **AI chat agents** — Google ADK powers the resume editing chat with tool-calling (read/edit via JSON Patch).
